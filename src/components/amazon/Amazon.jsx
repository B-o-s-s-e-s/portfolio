        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Amazon Fresh offers low prices on everyday items plus free same-day
          delivery and pickup in select locations for Prime members. It
          introduces new ways to make grocery shopping more convenient. The
          redesign of Amazon Fresh was centered around providing an easier way
          for Fresh users to access products that they wish to procure by
          limiting the number of clicks they need to go through. The redesign
          aims to solve this by providing shortcuts and easier navigation
          options for users, this eliminates inconvenient scrolls and page
          navigation. To help customers manage their shopping lists and better
          navigate their aisles. We created a way for customers to be able to
          select frequent cart items and advertise sale items to a line with the
          ease of accessibility.

          We conducted user research by distributing an online survey to Amazon
          gocery users which vary from daily active users to infrequent users.

          Number of Survey: 30

          Going further through the research, 2 personas were developed based on
          a sample of 30 amazon gocery users. Each persona has different
          characters, needs, and frustrations. These personas will be useful to
          improve the user experience. Say hi üëã to each persona:

          The high priorities fall into repurchasing past orders easily as well
          as finding ways to save money through sales. our medium category deals
          with frustration with scrolling, our user wants easy access to food
          categories.

          The flowchart displays an issue touched by our user in the user story.
          Amazon's current past purchase includes steps that become frustrating
          to users. we attempt to fix this by limiting the steps needed to
          reorder items which amazons competitors have already implemented{" "}

        <h2>Visual Design</h2>
        <h4>Moodboard</h4>
        <p>
          Since amazon fresh is an online grocery store, we felt inspired by
          nature hence why our approach touched on the color green and some
          shades of it. our users also use the app as a means to find meals and
          shop which is why we figured that the end goal of shopping is to
          prepare meals that bring smiles and joy. these are the inspiration we
          believe can help redesign the app and satisfy users.

          Our color pattern was is meant to e a connection to nature, although
          included here, we decided not to utilize it in our final product as it
          was not an issue during our research and discovery.

        <h2>Prototype/Testing</h2>
        <h4>Prototype</h4>
        <p>
          After accumulating the data from research and discoveries from users
          we put together a wireframe with the goal of solving our user
          frustrations. After conducting usability testing we received feedback
          from our users about the confusion regarding how items are added to
          carts.
        </p>
        <img src={lp}></img>
        <p>
          Improving upon the results of the mid-fidelity testing, the design of
          the high-fidelity was as follows. the cart issue was removed to
          alleviate confusion, also through our research sales recommendations
          based on their orders which is implemented in the past purchases tab.

        <img src={mp}></img>
        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <p>
          The feedback we received also helped us understand that our redesign
          was moving in the right step as these seem to be understood by the
          users.

        <h2>ü§îReflection</h2>
        <p>
          This was my first ever UX project! It was amazing experience to walk
          through an entire UX process. I've learned:{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Not process-driven. Always consider the UX process by order. UX
          process is not a team eqaully spliting the work without order. It is
          always always research first!!!

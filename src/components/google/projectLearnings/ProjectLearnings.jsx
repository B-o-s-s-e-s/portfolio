                    <div className='sectionText'>The first topic of discussion pertains to testing Google Maps users exclusively. The context of this discussion is not clear, but it may refer to a possible user study or experiment involving Google Maps users. It is unclear why the group is considering testing only Google Maps users, but it may be because the study or experiment is focused on a specific feature or aspect of the app that is only relevant to Google Maps users. Further information is required to provide more context and insight into this topic.</div>

                    <div className='sectionText'>The second topic is about forming questions that do not mislead users. This may refer to a survey or questionnaire that is being developed to gather data from users. The group is likely discussing how to frame questions in a way that does not lead users to provide biased or inaccurate responses. This requires careful consideration of the wording and structure of the questions, as well as an understanding of the potential biases and assumptions that may be present. The group also mentions gradually learning how to use and survey data, which may suggest that they are still in the process of developing their research methodology and refining their approach to data collection and analysis.</div>
